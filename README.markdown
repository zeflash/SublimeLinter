SublimeLint
=========

A code-validating plugin with inline highlighting for the [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com "Sublime Text 2") editor.

Supports the following languages:

* Python - native, moderately-complete lint
* PHP - syntax checking via "php -l"
* Perl - syntax+deprecation checking via "perl -c"
* Ruby - syntax checking via "ruby -wc"

Installing
-----

*Without Git:* Download the latest source from http://github.com/aroberge/sublimelint and copy sublimelint_plugin.py and the sublimelint/ folder to your Sublime Text "User" packages directory.

*With Git:* Clone the repository in your Sublime Text Packages directory (located one folder above the "User" directory)

> git clone git://github.com/lunixbochs/sublimelint.git


The "User" packages directory is located at:

* Windows:
    %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/
* OS X:
    ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/
* Linux:
    ~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/


Using
-----

SublimeLint natively supports Python (using pyflakes) and supports using PHP via "php -l" if PHP is in your $PATH.
There is also an option to use pylint (if present), instead of pyflakes.

1. To enable the plugin to work by default, you need to set a user preference "sublime_linter" to true.
2. You can turn on/off the linter via a command view.run_command("linter_on") (or "linter_off") - even if you have not set a user preference before.

Note that the linter normally works in a background thread and is constantly refreshing when enabled.

3. To run a linter "once" (i.e. not always on in the background), you use
view.run_command("run_linter"), "LINTER") where "LINTER" is one of "Python", "PHP" or "pylint".
4. If you run a linter via a commmand as in 3. above, the realtime linter is automatically disabled. To reset to its previous state (on or off) AND to clear all visible "errors", you use the command
view.run_command("reset_linter").
